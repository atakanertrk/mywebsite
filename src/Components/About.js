		    	I was born in Eski≈üehir and lived there until my university education. After graduating from Salih Zeki Anatolian High School in 2017, I started Trakya University Computer Engineering.
				Being able to use in real life what I have learned and creating works that others can benefit from represents my main source of motivation.
				It has always been enjoyable for me to work on common projects and share what I know with others (and to explain in detail).
				Spending time in nature, picnics and swimming are the activities I enjoy the most.
